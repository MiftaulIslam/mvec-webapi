This project demonstrates the process of building a full-stack E-Commerce application using .NET Core and Angular. The project begins with setting up the development environment and utilizes both the .NET CLI and Angular CLI to create a multi-project solution. It follows best practices such as the Repository, Unit of Work, and Specification patterns, and implements ASP.NET Identity for user authentication and role-based authorization. The application leverages Angular modules for lazy-loaded routes, Angular Material and Tailwind for UI design, and Redis for caching the shopping basket. Additionally, a full shopping cart and order system are implemented, complete with payment processing using Stripe, following EU 3D Secure standards. The project is structured for scalability, including the use of multiple DbContext boundaries. Key features of this project include paging, sorting, searching, filtering, reusable Angular form components, and validation using Angular Reactive Forms. Deployment to Azure is demonstrated, and real-time communication is handled using SignalR. This repository provides practical insights into building a modern web application using .NET Core and Angular.
